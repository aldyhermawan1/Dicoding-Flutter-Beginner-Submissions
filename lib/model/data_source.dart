When the wall dissipated, Batra had fled and Greaves was left in an empty room.

          Not wanting Batra to ever get the opportunity to report to the rest of REALM what he had tried to do, Greaves framed Batra for intentionally stealing the relic and trying to kill the captain in the process. Using this fabricated story and his rank in the force, Greaves sent convoys out after Batra with the specific order to kill Batra rather than just capture him, forcing him to go on the run throughout southern Asia. With the powers of the bracelet now attached to him though, Batra was more than capable of keeping himself safe from however many men REALM sent to eliminate him, being able to summon shields and walls of water to protect himself and sweep his enemies away.

          After almost two months of being pursued by REALM, a lifeline arrived in the form of the VALORANT Protocol, who appeared to have a peculiar interest in him specifically. Batra agreed to an extraction and was picked up by the organization, allowing him to escape from REALM's manhunt for good. With his recruitment into the VP, Batra became its twenty-first agent, "Harbor". Now, he has a new mission in a very different conflict, as the Protocol seeks answers behind the powers and origins of his bracelet, and what their adversaries from Omega might be using it for.
